# Simple Todo App

A simple and interactive Todo application that allows users to add, manage, and keep track of their tasks efficiently. The app features form validation to ensure proper input handling and provides a smooth user experience with a popup-based task entry system.

## Functionality

- Users can add new tasks by filling out a form with a task name and due date.

- Each task is displayed in a structured list format for easy tracking.

- Form validation ensures that required fields are filled before submission.

- The submit button is disabled when inputs are invalid.

- Tasks are generated dynamically and added to the list upon submission.

- The form is reset and validated upon successful submission, ensuring a clean input experience.

- The form remains unchanged when closed without submission to prevent accidental data loss.

## Technology

- JavaScript (ES6+): Handles form validation, dynamic task creation, and event listeners.

- HTML & CSS: Provides the structure and styling of the application.

- UUID Library: Generates unique IDs for each task.

- Modular JavaScript: Implements object-oriented programming with separate components for better maintainability.
